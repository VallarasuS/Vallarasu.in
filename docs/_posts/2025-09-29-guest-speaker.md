Invited as a guest speaker?

I often get to speak with students, here are some practical tips for a successful guest speech at a school or college.

- Bring some gift like a pen or small notebook for the person receiving you, could be a student, staff or the head.

- Arrive early and talk to the staff to understand who you're speaking to and what they expect.

- Assume the technology will be outdated. Bring your presentation on a USB drive, as a PDF, and on your own laptop.

- Don't try to teach them everything. Instead, spark their interest with a single idea or story they can explore later.

- Share your own life experiences to connect with students. This works better than theory.

- Present the idea at all levels, easy to hard. You can't reach every student equally.

- Politely take complex questions offline. Be prepared for common questions about placements and interviews.

- If there's a tech problem, talk to the students instead of just waiting.

- You might be surrounded by students and miss breaks. Have a snack or drink handy.

- Clearly tell students how they can connect with you after the speech (e.g., LinkedIn, email)

- Some questions may be very obvious for you, but not for them. Handle them with grace.

- Bring your business card to connect with other guests. You may get a very little time to connect with them.

You've got this! :)
