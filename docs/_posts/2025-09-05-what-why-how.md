Most often than not, learners are introduced to a subject, 
instructed to learn key ideas and evaluated by how well they remember it.

This is how schools and colleges operate even today, 
although the syllabus is designed to build from past learning,
even facilitators fail to note the coherence, and ideas are left behind after exams.

What surprised me was that recent graduates were able to provide 'definition' of something, 
but fail to understand and convey core idea of anything that they were taught.

'Why' you learn is just as important as 'What' you learn, 
I would also add 'How', to learn how it works.

Next time you learn anything, remember to ask what, why and how.

Happy Learning
