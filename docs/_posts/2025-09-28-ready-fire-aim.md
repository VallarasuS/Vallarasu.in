I wasn’t posting progress here for you guys, but working on producing content for other channel.
The new channel metrics is taking over the my personal channel’s life time metrics. 

I am taking a step back and thinking about how to proceed further. 

Here is what I’m thinking of at the moment.
- producing timeless learning content on personal channel
- ⁠infotainment short lived content on the new channel

New channel is also focused on technology so I believe both can converge at some point.
For now this is about increasing the luck surface. And It’s all an experiment at this moment.


Reminded of a book titled ~  “Ready, Fire, Aim” 🔥
Enjoy your weekend!
