I regularly take part in reading spaces happening on X, #பரியின்பனுவல்பட்டறை & #குட்டிச்சுவரு_ReadingClub in particular.

Few other un-structured talks happen in the morning, on one of those talks the topic of 'AI' came up.
I suggested that we do more of these 'tech talks' and thozhar 'கென்ஷின் ஹிமுரா' (@MrKammiNaughty) said We can start one, and here we are with our own space.
