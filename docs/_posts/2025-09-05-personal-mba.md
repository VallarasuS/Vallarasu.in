'Personal MBA' by 'Josh Kaufman' is one of the best books that I've come across recently.

Truely a page turner, lot of wisdom in every chapter.
If you are a business owner or aspire to be one, this book is a must have.

Although the book is available in it's entirity in his website, I went ahead and bought a physical copy, cause this is one of those books you keep coming back to.

The book talks largely about Business, People and Systems.
Although organized as modules and chapters, each ideas and chapters stand on-their own, serving as a quick reference.

Josh Kaufman defines business as a function of following five parts.
Remove any one, then you dont have a business.

- Value Creation: something of value, people want or need.
- Marketing: creating awareness and demand for value created.
- Sales: turning attention into paying customers.
- Value Delivery: delivery what you've promised and ensuring customer satisfaction.
- Finance: making enough money to sustain your efforts.

Kaufman dives into details of each function and presents prevalent ideas. A worthy read.
