Fish where the fishes are. 

There is a saying ‘to fish go where the fishes are’. This applies to all aspects of life.

If you are a graduate the first thing you do is to move to a city where the jobs are. This might sound very obvious but you would be surprised to learn most recent graduates spend close to an year at home.

- Step out of your comfort, and move to the city of your interest.
- Move in with friends or seniors who are also searching for jobs.
- Connect with others who are also in the same city and stay informed of job openings and walk-ins.

Remember for most of us it takes six months to one year to land your first job. 

Keep showing up, you’ve got this!
