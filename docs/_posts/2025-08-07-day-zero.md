August 6th marked 7th year aniversary at work with my current employer. The longest ever with any one employer.

Sounds like a long time, but all 15 years of career feels like yesterday. 

The first five years were driven by numbers, lot of learnings and was living on the edge, 
Slowed down on Second five years, family became a priority on third five years COVID happened during this time, and I actually got to watch my child grow at home.

Stepping on to the fourth five year block, likely the last one in IT industry, no concrete plans but who knows!
Might as well be coding for fun! :)
