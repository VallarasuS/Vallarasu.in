- Python's name was inspired by 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'.
- Python is an interpreted language. Compiled to a byte-code but still interpreted at execution.
- A compiler translates program from one language into another, (byte-code in java).
- This machine code is then executed, with-out the need for the source.
- Byte-code being native to the hardware it runs gives it time/speed advantage.
- But an interpreter like its literal meaning, translates the program line by line at execution.
- Interpreted at executed at run time has it's advantages and dis-advantage.

### Interpreter
<p style="margin-left: 10px; font-style: italic">
    Imagine reding a book written in french without knowing it. 
    You choose someone who knows french to read and translate (interpret) in english for you.
    Every time you read this book, the interpreter helps you translate it for you.
    One down side is this interpreter may not match your reading speed as you do on your own.
</p>

### Compiler
<p style="margin-left: 10px; font-style: italic">
    Now imagine reading it with a compiler. 
    Compiler reads and translates whole book. 
    Writes an english version of the book for you.
    Now the upside of this method is, interpreter don't follow you everywhere. 
    And you can read the book as fast as you can.
