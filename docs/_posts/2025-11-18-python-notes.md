- Python's name was inspired by 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'

- Python is an interpreted language. Compiled to a byte-code but still interpreted at execution.

- A compiler translates program from one language into another, (byte-code in java).

- This machine code is then executed, with-out the need for the source.

- Byte-code being native to the hardware it runs gives it time/speed advantage.

- But an interpreter like its literal meaning, translates the program line by line at execution.

- Interpreted at executed at run time has it's advantages and dis-advantage.
