Recently observed colleges in cities attract a large population of students.
The same pattern is noticed in schools but that's because of different reason. 
Blue / White collar labours who migrated earlier have now settled in cities and their children are in schools.

But colleges are in a different league of their own. 
Studens and parents choose colleges based on the packages offered in placements.
That is concerning for two reasons, one, it doesn't prioritize learning, second, it can be manipulated.

You fund one outlier, and the average shoots up. 
It's the same playbook of funding top scorers or sports persons from higher secondary and ranking among the top in university.

Hope we choose learning!!
