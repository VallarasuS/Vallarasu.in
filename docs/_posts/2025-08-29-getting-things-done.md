Do you know that feeling of being busy and making lot of progress, 
But no meaningful outcome emerges?

We humans expect an outcome, and uder pressure compelled to do 'something' or make a 'change'.
But forget whether doing 'something' results in desired outcome or not.

Why does it happen? 
It can only be one of two choices, either you are not aware or avoiding the obvious.
Let's ignore 'going around' obvious that moves the needle for this thought. 

Now what can you do to 'get things done'?
Let's work backwards from desired outcome.
Well! first, thing is to define the outcome. 
Second, think of ways to arrive the outcome.
Then break it down to monthly, weekly milestones.
And then identify action items to reach each milestone.
Finally Act on it.

If you are busy working but not chekcing on each planned action items, 
you are probably faking progress.
