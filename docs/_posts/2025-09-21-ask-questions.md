Don’t be afraid to ask questions.

Interview is not about testing whether you know the answer. It’s about how you approach and solve a problem.

Next time you are presented with a problem, don’t sit in silence. 

Ask clarifying questions, questioning is not weakness.

- it’s a sign of strength
- sign that you are collaborative
- shows you think thoroughly

When question is to divide a number, ask if you have to deal with dividing by zero.

So go in there and ask! You’ve got this ✌️
