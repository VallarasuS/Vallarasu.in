Do you write down your resolutions?

Well I used to write them down, last one I did had reading Ramayana, and Maha Bharatha.
For a fact I gave up on resolutions long back, cause it never worked out for me.

But then there was one for years to reduce financial burden, the one I took very seriously this year.
I haven't done anything of significance to cherish or remember this year, and stuck to absolute necessities.
And it got me closer to being debt free.

Do I have one for the year 2025?

I don't know, don't have anything specific yet.
Year 2024 gone by with lot of health issues and down time, perhaps having one for health and lifestyle changes would be great!

As always writing one down doesn't help, but focusing on health is a necessity.
So yeah that's the theme for the year ahead.

Have you heard of the term misogi? 

A 'year defining' event, that is so hard it stays with you for the year,
perhaps it is health for me this year.

What's yours? - happy new year!
