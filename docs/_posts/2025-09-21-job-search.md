Job Hunting? Here Are Some Practical Tips to Land Your Next Role

Not every opportunity shows up on big platforms like LinkedIn or Naukri. Many hide on niche job boards or stay with recruitment consultancies. Here's how to uncover them:

- Hunt on niche boards: Identify job sites specific to your industry and check them daily. (E.g., HasJob for tech roles.)
 
- Set up alerts: Most platforms let you subscribe to notifications. turn them on to stay ahead.

- Connect with consultancies: Reach out directly and upload your resume. (E.g., TeamLease for diverse sectors.)

- Target older postings: Teams sometimes pause interviews but keep roles open. Search for jobs posted in the last 6 months and message the hiring manager or team.

- Spot startups & small teams: If a company is just launching, they're likely hiring. These spots are perfect for hands-on learning and fast growth.
