### Fish where the fish are

No matter what your title is or what you do for a living, 
Believe it or not! all of you are in sales!

Be it work, service or a piece of art, you sell it to make a living!

But then how many of you are good at it?
Let alone realize you need to have it first!

Next time you set out to do anything figure out: 
- what you are going to sell
- who you are going to sell
- why they should buy from you

if you are going to be fishing, go where the fishes live.
narrow down your market and step into the buyers shoes,
may be then you will find the answers yourself first!
