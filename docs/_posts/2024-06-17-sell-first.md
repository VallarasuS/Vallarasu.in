### Sell First

The curse of the developers are those projects that never see the light of the day!
And the hundreds of those iterations perfecting it, even before you know if a customer exists! 

All of you at some point hustle and build many projects!
Some wont even finish!

If you have to convince customers to use your product, 
You dont have product market fit.

Find your customers, get upfront payments!
Sell the idea to your ideal customers first before you code.

Here is one such example of mine - an e-commerce app that never found any buyers!
