The curse of the developers are those projects that never see the light of the day!
And the hundreds of those iterations perfecting it, even before you know if a customer exists! 

All of you at some point hustle and build many projects!
Some wont even meet the finish line!

If you have to convince someone to use your product, 
You dont have product market fit.

Find your ideal customers, get upfront payments!
Sell the idea to your customers first before you code.

Here is one such example of mine - an e-commerce app that never found any buyers!
