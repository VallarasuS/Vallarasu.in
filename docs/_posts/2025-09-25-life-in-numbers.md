Life is a game, a game of numbers.

The game doesn’t end when 3 life’s are lost and it says it’s over. 
It ends only when you choose to put the console down.

if you are playing a game you dont enjoy playing, choose another one. But You truly have infinite attempts. 
Life is like that, get back up and show up stronger!

You’ve got this ✌️
