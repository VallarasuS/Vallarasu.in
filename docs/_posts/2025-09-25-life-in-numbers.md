Life is a game, a game of numbers.

For some it's easy, for others it's hard. 
But all you need is sufficient number of tries to complete any level.

The game doesn’t end when 3 lives are lost and the game says it’s over. 
It ends only when you choose to put the console down.

If you are in a game you don't enjoy playing, choose another one. 
But you truly have an infinite number of attempts. 

Life is like that; get back and show up stronger!

You’ve got this!
