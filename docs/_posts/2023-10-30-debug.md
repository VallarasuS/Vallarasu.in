### Debug

- When the reason isn't obvious deduce. Just like sudoku, when you cant find what is possible, deduce what is not possible.
- There will always be a time where a fix is deployed but the bug still exists. Being able to reproduce is a guranteed way to address a bug, where possible always try to reproduce.
- Spoting a bug in the code is a super power, the more you notice it the better you get at producing good quality code.
- Spoting a bug in code, comes with a precodition that the code is human readable. Chances are you as author will catch it while you write it or gets caught in review.
