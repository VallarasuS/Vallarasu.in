When I give students few playing cards and ask them to sort, they do it instantly.
But when I ask them to code it, they fail to do so.

Do you know why? 
Because they start thinking in a programming language alien to them.

Solving a problem and coding it are two different things.
When you are given a problem, break it down and solve it on a paper step by step, coding comes afterwards.

You will start doing it subconsciously when you internalize the process, just as you did with the cards.
When you understand this, you will be ahead of most programmers.

Wish you the best! :)
