Recruiters reaching out to you? 

Online Profiles and presence is as much as effective as an active job application. A complete profile can help recruiters find you, and to stand out from your peers.

Optimize your profile for the job you need and your profile will start showing up on recruiter searches!

Look for LinkedIn notifications when it says ‘you have appeared on a search’. That’s an indication of what your profile stands for. 

If it’s a mismatch, work on improving your profile with relevant skills and terms for job search. ex: ‘full stack developer’

- Upload your resume and pin it at the top of your profile.

- Profile Picture, Banner and Tagline, everything is an opportunity to market your skills

- Ask for recommendations from places and people you’ve worked with.

Your profile is your marketing tool, stay active and build a compelling one.

You’ve got this ✌️
