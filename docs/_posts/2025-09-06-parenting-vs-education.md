Teachers sending children loads of home work, <br>
Are they meant for kids? or Parents?

Working parents offloading education to school, <br>
to be relieved of responsibility.

School enforcing admission only for <br>
children with literate parents (both!).

Parents who can't offord to send children to school, <br>
Schools operating for a single child.

Parents who can offord home schooling for their children, <br>
Labourers who have none at home, to look after their children leaving them at school.
