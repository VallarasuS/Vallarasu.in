Parenting vs Education?

Teachers sending children loads of home work, 
Are they meant for kids? or Parents?

Working parents offloading education to school, 
to be relieved of responsibility.

School enforcing admission only for 
children with literate parents (both!).

Parents who can't offord to send children to school,
Schools operating for a single child.

Parents who can offord home schooling for their children,
Labourers who have none at home, to look after their children leaving them at school.

Parenting vs Education
Home vs Schools

Are they any different?
