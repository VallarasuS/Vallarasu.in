The world around us is built on beliefs and stories.

While some provide meaning and direction in life, Others become barriers.

It is the stories we tell ourselves that becomes psychological barrier. <br>
And it is important to be aware of it, if you have one.

Running a mile under 4 minute was believed impossible. <br>
Until it was broken by “Roger Bannister”. <br>
All of a sudden others began to break the 4 minute mark.

It always seems impossible until it’s done.
Are you aware of your limiting beliefs?
