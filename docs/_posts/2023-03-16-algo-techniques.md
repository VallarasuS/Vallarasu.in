### On manipulating arrays

- Find the base case first

- Solve for one step, then repeat

- Start from end N...0

- Seek from both ends and check if they meet

- If seeking a match is not intutive, Negate and ignore non-match

- Treat it as two different arrays: 0...n, n+1...N (tail recursion)

- Look for details, ie: Sorted arrays

- If it requires a lot of search, sort it first for binary search
