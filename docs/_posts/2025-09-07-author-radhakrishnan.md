I have been following author [Radhakrishnan Selvaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rk-radhakrishnan) for a while and got an opprtunity to meet him in person at Chennai.

Had a chance to talk about experiences, ideas and perspectives. Here are some notes to self.

- Book: 'The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed' <br>
- Put yourself out, write everyday. <br>
- Write about problem space than solution space. <br>
- Find people who will poke your ideas, and fill the gaps. <br>
- MVP must provide a tangible value to ideal customers, most importantly create an aha moment! <br>
- Break out of your existing circle. <br>
- Make yourself worthy of your prospects attention. <br>
- Most importantly break out of "Saviour Complex". <br>
