### Amazon Interview Guide: SDE

### Key Aspects of an Amazon Interview:
Preparation: The more preparation you do, the better your chances of success in the interview process.
    
### Evaluation Areas:
- Technical Competencies
- Amazon Leadership Principles

1. Technical Competencies:


- Coding, Data Structures, and Algorithms:
            Coding: Focus on code structure, modularity, maintainability, extensibility, testability, handling edge cases, time complexity, and memory complexity.
            Data Structures: Knowledge of arrays, linked lists, hash maps, hash tables, B-trees, B+ trees, AVL trees, binary search trees, graphs, sets, and more is crucial.
			
- High-Level Design (HLD) / Systems Design:
				Scalability & Performance: 
                Start with a problem statement like "Design Amazon's recommendation system."
                Gather requirements and define system constraints.
                Identify and couple system components.
                Consider design aspects like fault tolerance, scalability, concurrency control, resilience, and avoiding single points of failure.
				
- Low-Level Design (LLD):
            Define entities and their associations.
            Apply design principles and object-oriented programming concepts.
            Focus on coupling, extendibility, and system maintainability.
			Code Reviews / Design Reviews:


2. Leadership / Behavioral Aspects:

- Project Discussion: Be ready to talk about projects you were passionate about. Have at least two detailed examples prepared. Interviewers will probe to see your actual involvement in the project.
- Technical Competencies & Leadership Questions: Each interviewer will assess both your technical skills and leadership qualities through specific questions.
- Use Specific Data and Examples: Always back your answers with concrete examples and data.
- Handling Ambiguity: Amazon often deals with unclear or "half-baked" requirements. Demonstrate how you can take ownership and innovate or simplify solutions, as complex solutions lead to more issues.
- Managing Team Dynamics: Share examples of how you handle friction during team meetings or design discussions.
- Closing the Interview: Always have a couple of insightful questions ready to ask the interviewer. This shows your engagement and preparation. If similar questions come up across interviews, mention this to maintain transparency.
- Consistency in Responses: If you receive similar questions from different interviewers, acknowledge this. Honesty here is key as interviewers will debrief together, and inconsistencies can be a red flag.
