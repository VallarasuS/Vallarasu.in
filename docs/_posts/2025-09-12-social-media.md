There is no magic pill to social media, 
It's just about showing up consistently.

In showing up, either you figure-out your audience, or
your audience figures you out.

Some platforms reward content, 
Some reward connections,
Some reward sheer volume.

But all of them are shaped-by
Those who showed-up earlier.

Very reason why some resist change.
Adapt or stick to platforms that aligns with you.

text or visuals,
short or long,
just show up.
